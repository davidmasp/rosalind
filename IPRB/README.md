# Mendel Problem

Given: Three positive integers kk, mm, and nn, representing a population containing k+m+nk+m+n organisms: kk individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, mm are heterozygous, and nn are homozygous recessive.

Return: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.
